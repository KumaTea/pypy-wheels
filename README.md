## Other info

I'm personally impressed by the conception and the speed of PyPy.

However, PyPy works best with pure Python but not C extensions,
making it lacks some prebuilt wheels of the most popular packages.

I have made [prebuilt wheels before](https://github.com/KumaTea/ext-whl),
so this project is not too hard for me.
